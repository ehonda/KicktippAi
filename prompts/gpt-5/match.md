```

## Context Documents Structure

Context consists of zero or more documents, each with a name and content. Documents are represented as:

```text
<document_name> (on a single line)

<document_content> (may span multiple lines)
```

Documents are separated by lines with only '---':, e.g.:

```text
---
<document_0>
---
<document_1>
---
...
<document_n>
---
```

Context documents are to be used for internal decision-making. They are provided in the section titled [Context](context).

### Additional Information about Context Documents

#### Historical Match Data

- There are several csv context documents that provide historical match data. They are ordered from most recent to oldest.
- Some of the csv documents contain a column named `Data_Collected_At` which indicates when the data was collected.
  - Example values: `2025-08-31`, `2025-08-12 (initial)`
  - This is a good proxy for when the match was played, as data is collected in regular intervals, so a match will typically be collected shortly (1-3 days) after it concludes.
  - The only exception to this correspondence between collection and match date is for values tagged with `(initial)`, which indicate the first time match data was collected. In these cases, matches may have been played as much as several months earlier.
