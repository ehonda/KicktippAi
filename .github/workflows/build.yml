# Build and Test Workflow
#
# This workflow builds the solution and runs tests in parallel at the test project level.
#
# Architecture:
#   1. build            - Builds the entire solution once to catch compile errors early
#   2. define-test-matrix - Discovers test projects dynamically for parallel execution
#   3. test (matrix)    - Runs each test project in parallel using matrix strategy
#   4. merge-coverage   - Merges coverage reports from all test projects
#
# Design Decisions:
#   - Test projects run in parallel jobs for faster feedback as the test suite grows
#   - Each test job rebuilds its dependencies rather than sharing build artifacts because:
#     * Artifact upload/download adds significant overhead for our current build size
#     * Downloaded artifacts have permission issues on Linux runners
#     * Incremental builds via 'dotnet run' are fast enough for now
#   - Consider switching to artifact caching when build times become a bottleneck
#
# TUnit Note:
#   TUnit uses Microsoft Testing Platform with source generators, not VSTest.
#   Tests must be executed via 'dotnet run' (not 'dotnet test') on individual projects.
#
# Code Coverage:
#   - Coverage is collected using dotnet-coverage (from .config/dotnet-tools.json)
#   - Each test job uploads its coverage report as an artifact
#   - The merge-coverage job combines all reports into a single Cobertura XML file
#   - Configuration is in coverage.settings.json (filters to src/ assemblies only)
