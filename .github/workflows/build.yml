# Build and Test Workflow
#
# This workflow builds the solution and runs tests in parallel at the test project level.
#
# Architecture:
#   1. build            - Builds the entire solution once and uploads build artifacts
#   2. define-test-matrix - Discovers test projects dynamically for parallel execution
#   3. test (matrix)    - Downloads build artifacts and runs each test project in parallel
#   4. merge-coverage   - Merges coverage reports and generates HTML report
#   5. deploy-coverage  - Publishes HTML report to GitHub Pages (main branch only)
#
# Design Decisions:
#   - Test projects run in parallel jobs for faster feedback as the test suite grows
#   - Build artifacts are shared via actions/cache to avoid rebuilding in test jobs
#   - Cache key uses commit SHA to ensure each commit gets a fresh build
#
# TUnit Note:
#   TUnit uses Microsoft Testing Platform with source generators, not VSTest.
#   Tests must be executed via 'dotnet run' (not 'dotnet test') on individual projects.
#
# Code Coverage:
#   - Coverage is collected using dotnet-coverage (from .config/dotnet-tools.json)
#   - Each test job uploads its coverage report as an artifact
#   - The merge-coverage job combines all reports into a single Cobertura XML file
#   - ReportGenerator creates an HTML report published to GitHub Pages
#   - Configuration is in coverage.settings.json (filters to src/ assemblies only)
