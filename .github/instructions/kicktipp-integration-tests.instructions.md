# Kicktipp Integration Testing Guidelines

MAKE SURE to follow these when working on tests of the `KicktippIntegration` project, as we have specific setup that is required for proper test execution.

- The [README](../../tests/KicktippIntegration.Tests/README.md) contains important information about the project structure and dependencies. ALWAYS refer to it before making changes.
