# Project Style Guide Editing Instructions

ENSURE COMPLIANCE with these guidelines when editing the project style guide.

## Writing Style

- **Be concise**: Write clear and to-the-point instructions, without leaving out necessary details.
- **Clear structure**: Keep a consistent overall document structure. When adding new sections, follow the existing format, and look for the best place to insert them.

## Code Examples

- When adding or updating code examples, check whether they follow the established conventions in the style guide.
  - If not, modify them to align with the guide's standards.
  - **Exception**: If the example is intentionally demonstrating a "bad" practice, ensure it is clearly labeled as such. It is then necessary and fine that it violates the style guide.
