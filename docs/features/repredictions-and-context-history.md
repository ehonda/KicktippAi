# Repredictions and Context History

## Objective

We want to enable conditional reprediction of matchdays / bonus questions based on detected changes of context that was used as input to the generated predictions.

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Context Collection**: Fully implemented with versioned storage and automated workflows
- âœ… **Database Context Integration**: Completed - matchday commands now use stored context documents
- ðŸ”„ **Reprediction Logic**: Pending - implement `--repredict` and `--max-repredict-count` parameters
- âœ… **Verification Enhancements**: Completed - compare prediction timestamps with context changes
- ðŸ”„ **Workflow Updates**: Pending - integrate reprediction logic into automated workflows
- ðŸ”„ **Cost Command Updates**: Pending - include reprediction costs in calculations

## Requirements

### `collect-context` Command âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**

- âœ… **Command Structure**: Implemented as `collect-context kicktipp` subcommand using Spectre.Console composing commands pattern
- âœ… **Firebase Integration**: Full integration with versioned context document storage using `IContextRepository` and `FirebaseContextRepository`
- âœ… **Workflow Integration**: Individual GitHub workflows for `pes-squad` and `schadensfresse` communities, running every 12 hours
- âœ… **Versioned Storage**: Context documents stored with automatic versioning and duplicate detection
- âœ… **Change Detection**: Only stores new versions when content differs from latest version, preventing redundant storage
- âœ… **Community Context Support**: Uses `--community-context` parameter to organize context by scoring rules/community type
- âœ… **DateTimeOffset Usage**: Timezone-safe timestamps using `DateTimeOffset` instead of `DateTime`

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Uses community-context for organization rather than specific Kicktipp communities (more flexible approach)
- Collects context from all current matchday matches for comprehensive coverage
- Implements proper CLI inheritance with global and subcommand-specific options
- Firebase composite index required: `collection: context-documents, fields: community-context (Ascending), name (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)`

### Adjustments to `matchday` / `bonus` Commands for Database Context âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**

- âœ… **MatchdayCommand Database Integration**: Complete integration with Firebase context repository
  - Made `IContextRepository` a required service - Firebase configuration now mandatory
  - Replaced bulk context retrieval with targeted document fetching (7 specific documents per match)
  - Implemented hybrid approach: database-first with on-demand fallback and warnings
  - Added team abbreviation support for proper document name generation
  - Optimized performance: reduced from 47 to 7 context documents per match prediction

- âœ… **Context Document Targeting**: Retrieves exactly the same 7 documents as on-demand provider
  - `bundesliga-standings.csv` - current league standings
  - `community-rules-{communityContext}.md` - scoring rules for the community
  - `recent-history-{homeTeam}.csv` - recent match history for home team
  - `recent-history-{awayTeam}.csv` - recent match history for away team  
  - `home-history-{homeTeam}.csv` - home-specific match history for home team
  - `away-history-{awayTeam}.csv` - away-specific match history for away team
  - `head-to-head-{homeTeam}-vs-{awayTeam}.csv` - direct matchup history

- âœ… **Team Abbreviation Updates**: Updated hardcoded team abbreviations for 2025-26 Bundesliga season
  - Removed non-participating teams: `Holstein Kiel`, `VfL Bochum`
  - Added newly participating teams: `1. FC KÃ¶ln` (fck), `Hamburger SV` (hsv)
  - Maintains fallback logic for unknown teams

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Uses latest version of each context document type from the database
- Provides clear warnings when falling back to on-demand context generation
- Maintains backwards compatibility through graceful fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced verbose logging shows exactly which documents are retrieved and their versions

- **`bonus` command**
  - Already comes completely from the database
  - We can detect in `verify` that predictions (`createdAt`) are outdated compared to changes in kpi-documents (`updatedAt`)
  - _Here it's actually updatedAt, unlike matchday_

- Both commands must support `--repredict` and `--max-repredict-count`
  - Add a `RepredictIndex` to Firebase documents (starts at 0)

### Verification Enhancements âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**

- âœ… **VerifyBonusCommand Enhancements**: Complete outdated prediction detection for bonus questions
  - Uses only `IKpiRepository` (required service) for KPI document validation
  - Removed backwards compatibility with old naming schemes - follows current clean naming only
  - Compares bonus prediction `createdAt` timestamps with KPI document `createdAt` timestamps
  - Added `--check-outdated` parameter to enable timestamp-based validation
  - Enhanced `KpiDocument` model with `DateTimeOffset CreatedAt` property for timezone-safe comparisons
  - Proper Firebase Firestore timestamp conversion using `ToDateTimeOffset()`

- âœ… **VerifyMatchdayCommand Enhancements**: Outdated prediction detection for matchday predictions  
  - Uses `IContextRepository` for context document validation
  - Compares matchday prediction `createdAt` timestamps with context document `createdAt` timestamps
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with display suffix stripping (e.g., " (kpi-context)")
  - Enhanced error handling for missing context documents

**Key Implementation Differences:**

- **Bonus Predictions**: Use KPI documents only (team/manager data) - no context repository dependency
- **Matchday Predictions**: Use context documents (tables, matchday data) - context repository required
- **Timezone Safety**: All timestamps use `DateTimeOffset` instead of `DateTime` for proper UTC handling
- **No Normalization for Bonus**: Removed backwards compatibility logic - follows current naming scheme only
- **Maintained Normalization for Matchday**: Keeps display suffix stripping for context document lookups

### Adjustments to `verify` âœ… **COMPLETED**

- âœ… **Outdated Detection**: Compares matchday prediction `createdAt` timestamps with context document `createdAt` timestamps
- âœ… **Context Repository Integration**: Uses `IContextRepository` for context document validation
- âœ… **Display Suffix Handling**: Maintains backwards compatibility by stripping display suffixes like " (kpi-context)"
- âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing context documents with warning messages
- âœ… **Metadata Integration**: Leverages prediction metadata to identify which context documents were used
- âœ… **Verbose Logging**: Shows detailed context document checking when `--verbose` flag is used

**Implementation Notes:**

- Requires both prediction repository and context repository for outdated checking
- Checks all context documents that were used as input for the specific prediction
- Maintains existing prediction validation and Kicktipp synchronization logic

### Adjustments to `verify-bonus` âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Details:**

- âœ… **Outdated Detection**: Compares bonus prediction `createdAt` timestamps with KPI document `createdAt` timestamps
- âœ… **KPI Repository Integration**: Uses `IKpiRepository` as required service (no optional context repository)
- âœ… **Clean Naming Scheme**: Follows current document naming without backwards compatibility
- âœ… **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper error messages for missing KPI documents
- âœ… **Timezone Safety**: Uses `DateTimeOffset` for all timestamp comparisons
- âœ… **Verbose Logging**: Shows detailed timestamp comparison information when `--verbose` flag is used

**Key Features:**

- Validates that bonus predictions are not outdated compared to KPI documents used as context
- Returns exit code 1 when predictions are found to be outdated
- Maintains existing validation for prediction correctness and Kicktipp synchronization
- Only checks documents that were actually used as context input for the specific prediction

### Workflow Adjustments

- Always make predictions with `--repredict` and `--max-repredict-count 3` (or similar)
- This essentially replaces `--override-database`. That becomes deprecated
  - For backwards compatibility, we can initially just always overwrite the latest `RepredictIndex`

### Adjustments to `cost` Command

- Include reprediction costs in calculations
- Add repredictions (count and cost) as columns

## Testing Status

### Completed Verification Testing âœ…

- **VerifyBonusCommand**: Successfully tested with `--check-outdated --verbose` flags
  - Correctly detects outdated predictions when KPI documents are updated after prediction creation
  - Proper UTC timestamp comparison showing prediction vs KPI document creation times
  - Returns appropriate exit codes (1 for outdated predictions, 0 for valid predictions)
  - Example: Detected prediction created `2025-08-17 22:26:54 UTC` vs KPI document created `2025-08-18 21:47:23 UTC`

- **VerifyMatchdayCommand**: Context document outdated checking implemented
  - Uses context repository for timestamp comparisons
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with display suffix handling
  - Graceful error handling for missing context documents

### Completed Database Context Integration Testing âœ…

- **MatchdayCommand Database Context**: Successfully tested with updated context retrieval
  - Verified retrieval of exactly 7 context documents from database (down from 47)
  - Confirmed proper document targeting: standings, community rules, team histories, head-to-head
  - Validated team abbreviation updates for 2025-26 Bundesliga season participants
  - Tested fallback mechanism when database documents are incomplete
  - Example output: `Using all 7 context documents from database` with version information for each document
